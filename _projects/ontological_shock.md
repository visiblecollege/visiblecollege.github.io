title: Ontological shock
description: Everyone who has made the transition from thinking a controversial subject that challenges conventional worldviews is not worth taking seriously to thinking it <i>is</i> worth taking seriously has experienced, first-hand, a destabilization of their own worldview.<br/><br/>This experience is so common that it has been given the name “ontological shock.” <br/><br/>We have convened a team of researchers in the fields of anthropology, medicine, and psychology, among others, to study these effects and share findings in various formats that we hope will benefit researchers, mental health professionals, policymakers, and others interested in the subject.
