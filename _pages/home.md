We are a volunteer group of scholars conducting and promoting serious research into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) and related topics.

Our work has been underway at various levels for some time now, but we have just begun to work together publicly.

#### Our **mission**

To produce, collaborate on, curate, and share high quality research and educational materials that enable other researchers, policymakers, and the public to better understand this complex topic.

We do not advocate for any particular conclusions, nor do we make any claims to exclusive knowledge or authority. Our group is bound only by our common commitment to open-minded, rigorous inquiry, and by our belief that the best way to make progress is to work together, in the open.
