The critical study of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) can be daunting, especially for newcomers. This is our attempt to get you up to speed on why we believe this subject area is worthy of serious scholarly attention.

There is compelling evidence that [key figures in the U.S. government](#us-government-testimony) are taking the UFO/UAP phenomenon very seriously, and that the U.S. government has been covering up information about UFOs and extraterrestrial life for decades. This has led to [several pieces of legislation and official reports](#legislation-and-reports) that increasingly support these extraordinary claims. Furthermore, there is direct [scientific evidence](#scientific-evidence) from civilian sources that confirm the reality of UAP. Finally, there is significant [historical evidence](#historical-background) that UAP have been observed all through human history.

### US Government Testimony

**[Luis Elizondo](https://youtu.be/2OMGOvuJV5M)** first came into the public eye through a [New York Times article in 2017](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html) that revealed the existence of the [Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Aerospace_Threat_Identification_Program) and [provided three videos of UAP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBtMbBPzqHY) shot by Navy pilots. Elizondo claims that Non-Human Intelligences (NHI) regularly send technological craft into controlled US airspace and engage military resources, as has previously been alleged by **[Lieutenant Bob Jacobs and Lieutenant Robert Salas](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/10/19/air-force-veterans-who-are-ufo-true-believers-return-newly-attentive-washington.html)**. Elizondo confirms **[Lieutenant Colonel Jesse Marcel's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Marcel)** claims about the [reality of the crash at Roswell in 1947](https://youtu.be/iHOVsqKBSK8) and that the US government is in posession of recovered materials from that and other incidents. In other recent interviews, Elizondo claims that the Department of Defense is in posession of [hundreds of high-resolution videos of UAP](https://youtu.be/9gLPtRwXgCM?si=s9p4c32wdPiG8pJm&t=1375) making it clear they are advanced technological craft,  and that [he has seen the video](https://www.youtube.com/live/DOeB_sPjyMA?si=KyQJYddJ-ibdC4bC&t=780) allegedly recorded by Bob Jacobs in 1964 in [which a flying saucer destroys a missile in mid-flight](https://www.the-sun.com/news/us-news/3887488/ufo-firing-four-beams-light-nuclear-missile-aliens/). Elizondo claims [he has held a technological implant](https://youtu.be/wgM5V44eQHU?si=um9fmmTKgFVvnQPk&t=698) removed from a US service member. Though the Department of Defense has sometimes denied Elizondo's role in AATIP, [recent FOIA documents](https://documents2.theblackvault.com/documents/dod/21-FR-0964.pdf) have [confirmed his role in the program](https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/aatip-memo-unveiled-after-foia-battle-dod-inconsistencies-exposed/#google_vignette). Elizondo has recently been giving clearance by the Department of Defense to publish [a book about his experiences in AATIP](https://www.amazon.com/Imminent-Pentagons-Investigating-UAPs_Featured-Experience/dp/0063235560).

**[David Grusch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Grusch_UFO_whistleblower_claims)** made public similarly extraordinary claims in the summer of 2023. In particular, he alleged that the [US government has been running a secret UFO recovery program](https://thedebrief.org/intelligence-officials-say-u-s-has-retrieved-non-human-craft/) since at least the 1940s and that multiple alien craft and alien have been successfully recovered. Grusch's story backs up claims made by **[Lieutenant Colonel Philp Corso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_J._Corso**)** who alleged that he was involved in reverse engineering projects using recovered UFO materials. Grusch's credentials as a highly cleared intelligence officer who had access to the kind of information that would be required confirm these claims have been thoroughly fact checked [[1](https://thedebrief.org/fact-check-q-a-with-debrief-co-founder-and-investigator-tim-mcmillan-part-1/), [2](https://thedebrief.org/fact-check-q-a-with-debrief-co-founder-and-investigator-tim-mcmillan-part-2/), [3](https://thedebrief.org/fact-check-q-a-with-debrief-co-founder-and-professional-investigator-tim-mcmillan-part-3/)]. Before going public, Grusch provided extensive classified information in a whistleblower complaint to the current Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, **[Thomas Monheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Monheim)**. Monheim reportedly stated that Grusch's claims are "credible and urgent". Grusch and two Navy pilots [testified under oath](https://youtu.be/KQ7Dw-739VY) on these matters before the House Oversight Committee on July 26, 2023. On January 12, 2024, Monheim briefed members of that committee in a sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF) and those members have publically stated that [Grusch's claims are being taken very seriously](https://youtu.be/uCAe5N_CDO0?si=0zKmaFyuKaQQjMtm). 

Elizondo and Grusch are not alone in their claims. **[Colonel Karl Nell](https://www.salt.org/speakers/karl-nell)** has stated in no-uncertain terms that [Non-Human Intelligences have been interacting with humanity](https://x.com/SALTConference/status/1793723843321692305?lang=en) and this has been ongoing for quite some time. **[Christopher Mellon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Mellon)**, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, has been a close ally of Elizondo since at least 2017. Mellon has [advocated strongly for UAP disclosure](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/06/03/ufo-crash-materials-intelligence-00100077) and has offered compelling reasons [why the secret might have been kept from the public](https://youtu.be/nifLdoJYamQ?si=a142l785lFdHgJ5M) in the interest of political stability. **[Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet](https://www.navy.mil/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Print.aspx?PortalId=1&ModuleId=692&Article=2236233)**, former head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has not only [confirmed the claims made by David Grusch](https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/navy-officer-supports-ufo-claims/), but has gone further to claim that [similarly anomalous objects have being detected underwater](https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/navy-rear-admiral-speaks-out-about-uap-sightings-in-new-paper-211902021618) on a regular basis. **[General H.R. McMaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._McMaster)**, National Security Advisor to President Trump, [confirms that there are phenomena in the sky that are inexplicable by current science](https://www.instagram.com/dancleary79/reel/C_mb6-jJx8q/).   

Though they have not been quite so bold as the people mentioned above, President Barack Obama has confirmed that [UAP are real objects that behave in ways we cannot explain](https://youtu.be/xp6Ph5iTIgc?si=3AEkXW_CD40_sdJD&t=43) and President Donald Trump has stated he was briefed by [Air Force F-22 pilots who engaged a round object that significantly outpaced them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNGBB52inSk&t=2019s). Vice President Kamala Harris [has conspicuously dodged direct questions on the topic](https://youtu.be/Ne3-KA8ja6g?si=kF8n94jiBt485neD&t=658).
