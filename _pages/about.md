We are a volunteer group of academics and professionals conducting and promoting serious research into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) and related topics.

#### Our **mission**

We don't claim to have any particular authority on this subject matter, but believe progress can be made only if we work together to reduce the stigma traditionally associated with this subject and share all the good work happening across the community.

With that in mind, our primary mission is to produce, collaborate on, and share high quality research and educational materials that we hope will enable other researchers, policymakers, and the public to better understand this complex subject.

#### Our **name**

In [The Invisible College](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-College-Scientists-Discovered-Influence/dp/1938398270), by Jacques Vallee, we encountered the work of a cadre of researchers who were working in secrecy, or at least anonymity, to better understand the UFO phenomenon. 

As the topic of UAP has gone increasingly mainstream in recent years, more and more academics and professionals have begun to feel comfortable taking the subject seriously and speaking publicly about it -- "The Invisible College" is gradually becoming visible.
