We are a volunteer group of scholars conducting and promoting serious research into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) and related topics.

#### Our **name**

J. Allen Hynek, the well known scientific consultant to the US Air Force, once [referred](https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/ufos-and-the-boundaries-of-science/) to the group of academics working on the UFO subject in secrecy or at least anonymity as "The Invisible College." Jacques Vallee picked up this designation for the title of his book [The Invisible College: What a Group of Scientists has Discovered about UFO Influences on the Human Race](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-College-Scientists-Discovered-Influence/dp/1938398270).

As the topic of UAP has gone increasingly mainstream in recent years, more and more scholars have begun to take the subject seriously, and to speak publicly about it -- "The Invisible College" is gradually becoming visible.
