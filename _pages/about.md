We are a volunteer group of scholars conducting and promoting serious research into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) and related topics.

#### Our **name**

In [The Invisible College](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-College-Scientists-Discovered-Influence/dp/1938398270), by Jacques Vallee, we encountered the work of a cadre of researchers who have been laboring in secrecy, or at least anonymity, to better understand the UFO phenomenon.

As the topic of UAP has gone increasingly mainstream in recent years, more and more academics and professionals have begun to take the subject seriously, and to speak publicly about it -- "The Invisible College" is gradually becoming visible.
