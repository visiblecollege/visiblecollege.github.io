        <h4>The Nazca Mummies as Archaeological Objects</h4>
        <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
            <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RDgjeCYMq0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        <p class="mt-2"><small>Just about everyone who has looked into the Nazca Mummies so far has either concluded that they are modern fakes or the preserved remains of coherent ancient bodies. In this talk, I suggest a neglected alternative hypothesis: they are genuinely ancient archeological artifacts, made of parts of other bodies, in a way that is consistent with what we know about the ancient Nazca people.</small></p>
