Our team has been working behind the scenes for the past couple of months preparing a community platform to support connection and collaboration between scholars interested in UAP/NHI. Building on well established tools as much as possible, we’ve configured a Discord server and a Google Drive for our community to use as we develop and execute projects together. We are working on white papers for government bodies, peer-reviewed research for academic journals, educational resources for the public, and we are eager to branch out in any way we can be helpful at this critical moment.

Of course, the main value of the Visible College is the community. While some of us are professional academics, we prefer the term “scholar” because we recognize that serious academic-quality work happens in many places. Now, more than ever, we need to break down the walls between our individual fields of interest to promote massively multidisciplinary work. The paradigm case of a Visible Colleague might be someone with a PhD working at an accredited institution of higher learning, or a well-credentialed professional with subject matter expertise in a relevant field, but we consider all applications on a case-by-case basis. If you want to do high-quality, scholarly work in the UAP/NHI space and you are interested in joining us, please **[fill out an application](https://airtable.com/appBUMhfxcV8ZAOff/pagFa45OE2lxCJIYf/form)**!
